        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>How to Make Lasagna: To prepare lasagna from scratch, you start by making sauce, then layer it with wide, flat lasagna noodles and cheese before baking. The sauces can vary from tomato-based sauce, with or without meat, to creamy bechamel sauce, which works well with a wide variety of vegetables.</p>
        <p>How to Layer Lasagna: The basic building formula for lasagna is sauce, noodles, more sauce, then cheese. Repeat the noodle-sauce-cheese order until the pan is nearly filled, then end with sauce and cheese on top.
